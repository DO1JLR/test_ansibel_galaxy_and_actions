# test_ansibel_galaxy_and_actions
Here I will run some tests with ansible-galaxy and github-actions.

 What do I do here?
------------
I will test the deployment of ansible galaxy roles together with github actions.

Some Repos I use for this:
 - [role-ranger](https://github.com/chaos-bodensee/role-ranger)
 - [check-ansible-debian-stable-action](https://github.com/roles-ansible/check-ansible-debian-stable-action)
